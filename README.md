Time Tracking interface. This is a work in progress.

## Roadmap

This are the features this should have to be a working client:

1. Task tracking. Ingest a summary and transform it into a properly shaped report.
2. CLI client. Allow tracking data generation and persistence.
3. Import/export. Allow source data handling.
4. Templates. Replace given text with templated tasks.
5. Transformation. Allow arbitrary word replacements.
